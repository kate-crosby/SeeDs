# SeeDs data some potential project ideas

## Data description

1. Some 4700 individuals
2. 4127 with spatial coordinates and hence elevation (lat range -38 to 30)
3. Span in dates is 1943-2010 (some years sampled more intensely than others)
4.

## IDEA 1: 
The consistency/dynamics of the selection differential $s$ (probably better to look at this) or $\beta$ (not this - selection gradient) through time on a given trait or set of alleles underlying a trait.
The idea here is that the selection gradient may end up being a net 0 for a set of alleles (can we find a single population?). 

- Look at SNPs for GWAS - Alberto's paper.
- Does balancing or directional selection predominate through time on alleles that are affiliated with a fitness correlate early flowering?
- Track change in allele frequency affiliated with a given GWAS SNP for flowering time or whatever else Alberto measured through time $$\frac{df_{A}}{dt}=sf_{A}(1-f_{A})$$

We'll have to correct for population structure, and correlated temporal measurements - or just treat each year as a separate generation.

## SPACEMIX
Assess the movement of alleles associated with flowering time and their movement latitudinally through space. 

## Qx?
Should we try it out here? 


## Scan for Climate and local adaptation

Let us grab climate data from [here](http://www.worldclim.org/current) and conduct GWAS on them. We can follow the below papers for further interpretation.

[Fournier-Level et al, 2011](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21980109)

## Origin of the modern maize

Compute the relatedness of the Ames Inbred lines (N = 2,000) with SeeDs data. The results will enable us to investigate the following questions?

- The origin of the modern maize relative to the diverse landraces.
- The under-repsented landraces?
- The enrichment of the climate and local adaptation alleles in these under-repsented landraces?
