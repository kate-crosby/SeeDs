# SeeDs data some potential project ideas

## Data description

1. Some 4700 individuals
2. 4127 with spatial coordinates and hence elevation (lat range -38 to 30)
3. Span in dates is 1943-2010 (some years sampled more intensely than others)
4.

## IDEA 1: 
The consistency/dynamics of the selection differential $s$ (probably better to look at this) or $\beta$ (not this - selection gradient) through time on a given trait or set of alleles underlying a trait.
The idea here is that the selection gradient may end up being a net 0 for a set of alleles (can we find a single population?). 

- Look at SNPs for GWAS - Alberto's paper.
- Does balancing or directional selection predominate through time on alleles that are affiliated with a fitness correlate early flowering?
- Track change in allele frequency affiliated with a given GWAS SNP for flowering time or whatever else Alberto measured through time $\frac{df_{A}}{dt}=sf_{A}(1-f_{A})$

We'll have to correct for population structure, and correlated temporal measurements - or just treat each year as a separate generation.

## SPACEMIX
Assess the movement of alleles associated with flowering time and their movement latitudinally through space. 

## Qx?
Should we try it out here?
